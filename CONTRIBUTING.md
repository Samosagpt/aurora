This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Set up your development environment** (see below)
4. **Create a branch** for your feature or bugfix
5. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
6. **Test your changes** thoroughly

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues. When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
- **Provide specific examples** (code snippets, screenshots)
- **Describe the behavior you observed** and what you expected
- **Include your environment details** (OS, Python version, Ollama version)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description** of the suggested enhancement
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
- **List some examples** of how it would be used

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- **Beginner issues** - issues that should only require a few lines of code
- **Help wanted issues** - issues that may be more involved

### Pull Requests

- Fill in the required template
- Follow the coding style guide
- Include appropriate test cases
- Update documentation as needed
- End all files with a newline

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Ollama (for local LLM inference)

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aurora.git
   cd aurora
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. **Install Ollama models**

   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2
   ollama pull llava  # For vision features
   ```

6. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   # Web interface
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py

   # Console interface
   python main.py
   ```

### Running Tests

Aurora has a comprehensive testing infrastructure. For detailed information, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest test_aurora_system.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run only unit tests
pytest -m unit

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto
```

**Quick test checklist before submitting PR:**

```bash
# 1. Run pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files

# 2. Run unit tests
pytest -m "unit or not (integration or slow)"

# 3. Check coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing

# 4. Run full test suite (if time permits)
pytest -v
```

- Test categories and markers
- Writing new tests
- Using fixtures
- Code coverage
- CI/CD pipeline

Please refer to **[TESTING.md](TESTING.md)**

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with some modifications:

- **Line length**: Maximum 100 characters (not 79)
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Imports**: Group imports (stdlib, third-party, local)
- **Naming conventions**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions/variables: `snake_case`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Private methods: `_leading_underscore`

### Code Quality

- **Type hints**: Use type hints for function signatures
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions/classes
- **Comments**: Write clear, concise comments for complex logic
- **Error handling**: Use specific exceptions, avoid bare `except:`
- **Logging**: Use the logging module, not print statements

### Example

```python
from typing import Optional, List

def process_user_input(text: str, model: Optional[str] = None) -> dict:
    """
    Process user input and generate a response.

    Args:
        text: The user's input text
        model: Optional model name to use for generation

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing the response and metadata

    Raises:
        ValueError: If text is empty
        ConnectionError: If Ollama is not available
    """
    if not text.strip():
        raise ValueError("Input text cannot be empty")

    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally

**Format:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding/updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Example:**

```

- Integrated Qwen3-VL for improved screen analysis
- Added configuration options for vision models
- Updated documentation with usage examples

Closes #123
```
