## Test Coverage Gap

Describe the area that needs better test coverage:

**Module/Component**: [e.g., rag_handler.py, image_gen.py]

**Current Coverage**: [e.g., 45% or Unknown]

**Target Coverage**: [e.g., 80%]

## Missing Test Cases

List specific test cases that should be added:

1. [ ] Test case 1: [description]
2. [ ] Test case 2: [description]
3. [ ] Test case 3: [description]

## Test Categories

What types of tests are needed?

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance tests
- [ ] Edge case tests
- [ ] Error handling tests
- [ ] Regression tests

## Priority

How critical is this test coverage?

- [ ] High - Critical functionality
- [ ] Medium - Important but not critical
- [ ] Low - Nice to have

## Test Examples

If possible, provide examples of tests that should be written:

```python
import pytest

def test_example():
    """Test description."""
    # Test implementation
    pass
```

## Dependencies

Does this require any special setup or dependencies?

- [ ] Requires Ollama
- [ ] Requires GPU
- [ ] Requires external services
- [ ] Requires test data
- [ ] No special dependencies
